# webdev-portfolio
This repository showcases my portfolio website, developed for a school project. The site serves as a representation of my newly learnt skills, featuring a homepage with changing text to demonstrate some of the dynamic elements I’ve implemented like the hover effects and the changing text. The website is built using HTML and CSS.

When I first started this project, I didn’t have much interest in web development. However, as I worked through the process of designing and building this site, I discovered a genuine passion for it.

Looking ahead, I plan to continue evolving this portfolio, not just by adding new projects but improving my skills in web design and development. This experience has opened my eyes to the vast potential of web development as a skill, and I am excited to explore it further in future projects.

So, thank you, Mr. Shaibu.
